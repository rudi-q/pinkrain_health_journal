8. [ ] Add proper documentation for public APIs and complex functions
9. [ ] Implement proper logging strategy instead of using print statements
10. [ ] Fix the critical ID issue in HiveService (properly documented but should be refactored)

## Performance Optimization
1. [ ] Optimize large widget rebuilds using const constructors where appropriate
2. [ ] Implement caching for expensive operations
