## üèóÔ∏è Security Architecture

### Privacy-First Design

PinkRain implements a **zero-trust, local-first** architecture:

- **No Data Collection**: We never collect, store, or transmit user data
- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored locally using encrypted Hive database
- **No Cloud Sync**: Data never leaves the user's device
- **No Analytics**: No user behavior tracking or telemetry
- **Open Source**: Full transparency through open-source code

### Core Security Principles

1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect data necessary for app functionality
2. **Local Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
3. **No Network Transmission**: Personal data never leaves the device
4. **Secure Dependencies**: Regular security audits of third-party packages
5. **Transparent Code**: All security implementations are open source

## üîí Data Protection

### Local Data Security

- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive user data is encrypted using AES-256
- **Secure Key Management**: Encryption keys are generated and stored securely on-device
- **Data Isolation**: App data is sandboxed within the application container
- **Secure Deletion**: Proper data wiping when users delete information

### Data Categories

| Data Type | Storage Method | Encryption | Transmission |
|-----------|----------------|------------|--------------|
| Mood Entries | Local Hive DB | ‚úÖ Encrypted | ‚ùå Never transmitted |
| Medication Data | Local Hive DB | ‚úÖ Encrypted | ‚ùå Never transmitted |
| Audio Preferences | Local Storage | ‚úÖ Encrypted | ‚ùå Never transmitted |
| User Settings | Local Storage | ‚úÖ Encrypted | ‚ùå Never transmitted |
| ML Model Data | Local Assets | ‚úÖ Encrypted | ‚ùå Never transmitted |

### Data Retention

- **User Control**: Users can delete their data at any time
- **No Backup**: We don't create external backups of user data
- **App Uninstall**: All data is removed when the app is uninstalled
- **Data Export**: Users can export their data in encrypted formats

## üì± Supported Versions
